I've merged the relevant changes from culfw 1.40 to add support for the CUL v3.This will only compile the version for CUL v3.Files changed are:  * raw/makefile  * raw/board.h  * raw/raw.c  I also had to make minor changes to:  * MyUSB/Drivers/USB/LowLevel.cLook for CUL_V3 in the files to see the changes made.If you just want to install the firmware use the file NetHomeCULv3.hex.TODO======Makefile should be rewritten to support different versions of CUL as done in culfw.Christian Aune Thomassen / WTW Softwarechristian.thomassen@wtw.no
